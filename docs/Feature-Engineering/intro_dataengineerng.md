# Introduction to Data Engineering

## 2. What is Data Engineering?

- **Definition**: Design, build, and maintain scalable data systems and pipelines.
- **Main Goal**: Deliver clean, usable data to analysts, scientists, and stakeholders.

---

## 3. Why is Data Engineering Important?

- Transforms raw data into **reliable**, **consistent**, and **real-time** formats.
- Enables **data-driven decision making** across organizations.
- Supports ML models, BI tools, dashboards, and analytics.

## 7. Data Sources for ML and Analytics

### Primary Sources

- **Definition**: Raw, real-time data collected directly  
- **Examples**: Sensors, web scraping, client-side collection  
- **Pros**: Highly relevant, accurate  
- **Cons**: Time-consuming and costly

### Secondary Sources

- **Definition**: Pre-collected data by third parties  
- **Examples**: Kaggle, UCI, Google Dataset Search  
- **Pros**: Easy, fast access  
- **Cons**: May be outdated or less specific
